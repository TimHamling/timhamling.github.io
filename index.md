We are conducting a study on how people process and use product information on the Internet. You will be led to a set of brief simulated Internet sessions during which you will read a tutorial article, encounter commercial and social media messages, and browse products through a simulated Google search. Your task is to express your opinions about the products and their sponsors that you have encountered during the Internet sessions.
By participating in the study, you will receive extra course credit and learn how marketing research on consumer behavior on the Internet is conducted. Information collected in the study will be kept strictly confidential and be used only for research purposes. This study does not involve any emotional, mental, or physical risk or safety concerns.
For any questions or further information about the study, contact Professor D. H. Lee at dongh.lee@manhattan.edu.
